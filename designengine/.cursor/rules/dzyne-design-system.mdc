# dzyne Design System Rules

This project uses dzyne (dzyne.app) for persistent design memory. Before writing any UI code, you MUST load the design profile.

## At Session Start

Call the `get-design-profile` MCP tool to load the stored design system:
- If a project name is known, pass it: `get-design-profile({ projectName: "my-project" })`
- If not, call without arguments to get the most recent profile

The response contains: `tokens`, `components`, `tailwindConfig`, `cssVariables`

Use these for ALL styling decisions. Never hardcode colors, fonts, or spacing.

## Design Rules — Never Break These

### Colors
- NEVER use generic Tailwind colors (bg-blue-500, text-gray-600, etc.) unless they match the design profile
- Use CSS variables: `var(--color-primary)`, `var(--color-background)`, etc.
- The 60/30/10 rule: 60% background/surface, 30% primary/secondary, 10% accent
- All text must meet WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text)

### Typography
- Headings use the `heading` font family from the profile (typically a serif)
- Body text uses the `body` font family (typically a humanist sans-serif)
- Code uses monospace from the profile
- Use the modular type scale — don't invent arbitrary sizes
- Heading weights: 700-800. Body: 400. UI labels: 500.
- Tight line-height for headings (1.1-1.2). Relaxed for body (1.6-1.7).

### Spacing
- All spacing derives from 8px multiples: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128
- Sections need breathing room — minimum 96px padding on desktop, 48px mobile
- Card padding: 32px desktop, 24px mobile
- Related items should be closer together (proximity principle)
- Unrelated items need clear separation

### Border Radius
- Use the values from the design profile
- Be consistent — don't mix rounded-lg and rounded-xl on the same page
- Inner elements should have slightly smaller radius than outer containers

### Shadows
- Use warm-tinted shadows from the profile, not generic gray
- Shadow intensity should indicate elevation hierarchy: subtle for cards, stronger for modals
- Shadows should use the primary color at low opacity, not black

### Components
- Check the profile's `components` field for pre-defined patterns (button, card, input, heading)
- Use these patterns exactly — same classes, same CSS
- For new components, match the existing patterns

## Available MCP Tools

When building UI, use these tools in order of relevance:

1. `get-design-profile` — Load the design system (do this FIRST)
2. `generate-component-library` — Generate a full set of styled components
3. `generate-page` — Generate a complete page using the design system
4. `generate-layout` — Generate layout shells (sidebar, topnav, etc.)
5. `generate-theme-variants` — Generate dark mode and other theme variants
6. `check-design-consistency` — Verify code matches the design system
7. `generate-responsive-rules` — Get breakpoint behavior for all elements
8. `suggest-improvements` — Get accessibility and design improvement suggestions
9. `design-diff` — Compare two designs for drift

## Anti-Patterns — What AI Typically Gets Wrong

- Using bg-gray-950 with indigo-600 accents (the "AI developer tool" aesthetic)
- Using Inter/Geist for everything
- rounded-xl on everything (12-16px is too much for most designs)
- Dark mode by default without asking
- No visual hierarchy — everything the same size and weight
- No breathing room — elements crammed together
- Gray shadows instead of warm-tinted ones
- Missing focus states and hover transitions

## When In Doubt

Ask the user. Design decisions should be intentional, not defaulted.
